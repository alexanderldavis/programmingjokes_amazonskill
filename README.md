# Programming Jokes (Amazon Skill)

Don't you sometimes want a funny programming joke, but don't want to get up from your chair? Look no further! This is an Amazon Echo (Alexa) Skill that reads a programming-related joke.
This app will be operational (published to the Amazon skill library)!
This project was to familiarize myself with the AWS lambda and Alexa skill development.

The skill has been accepted for certification in the Amazon Echo skills library.

Installing the app on your Echo is aggresively easy:
Just say `Alexa, enable Programming Jokes`! Then, you can say `Alexa, ask Programming Jokes for a joke`, for a joke!
